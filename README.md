- used Weatherap service as a backend to this project [check them out](https://www.weatherapi.com/)

## Walk through
- first we have onboarding screen that's supposed to be shown only the first time openning the app.
- then we have a home screen shown after you give permission to location showing the current weather data in addition to tempratures along the whole day.
- then we have the forecast screen which shows the data for tomorrow and next 7 days.
